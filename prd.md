Okay, I understand. Building a secure and robust backend for a mobile payment application that can eventually partner with a capital bank is a significant undertaking, requiring careful planning and execution without compromising on critical aspects like security and authentication.

Based on your request and the context gathered from the existing Opay codebase, the NIBSS information, and the general guide on building payment apps, I will first outline a requirements document. This will ensure we have a clear scope and understanding of what needs to be built before we start coding.

Here is a draft requirements document for the mobile payment application backend:

**Mobile Payment Application Backend Requirements Document**

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the requirements for the backend system of a mobile payment application. The system will be built upon the existing Opay core codebase and will provide a secure, scalable, and reliable platform for managing user accounts, processing various types of payment transactions, and integrating with external financial services, including NIBSS APIs and future partner bank systems.

**2. Goals**
*   To provide a secure and user-friendly platform for mobile payment transactions.
*   To support various transaction types (P2P transfers, bill payments, withdrawals, etc.).
*   To manage user accounts and associated financial data securely.
*   To integrate seamlessly with external payment gateways (like NIBSS) and banking systems.
*   To ensure high availability, scalability, and performance.
*   To meet all relevant security and compliance standards.

**3. Users**
*   **End-Users:** Individuals using the mobile application to perform transactions, manage accounts, etc.
*   **Administrators:** Personnel managing the platform, monitoring transactions, handling support.
*   **Partner Bank Systems:** External systems interacting with the backend for settlement, account verification, etc.
*   **External Service Providers:** Payment gateways, KYC/AML providers, etc.

**4. Core Features**
*   **User Account Management:**
    *   Secure user registration and profile management.
    *   Account linking (e.g., linking to bank accounts, cards).
    *   Secure storage of user data and financial information.
*   **Wallet/Account Functionality:**
    *   Managing multiple currency balances (supporting the future partnership with a capital bank for currency storage).
    *   Viewing account balances and transaction history.
*   **Transaction Processing:**
    *   Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transfers between app users.
    *   Transfers to/from external bank accounts (via NIBSS NIP or similar).
    *   Bill payments (via NIBSS e-BillsPay or similar).
    *   Withdrawals.
    *   Handling different transaction states (PEND, DO, SUCCEED, FAIL, CANCEL) using the Opay core.
    *   Idempotent transaction processing.
*   **Transaction History and Notifications:**
    *   Providing users with a comprehensive history of their transactions.
    *   Real-time notifications for transaction status updates ([https://sdk.finance/how-to-build-a-payment-app/](https://sdk.finance/how-to-build-a-payment-app/)).

**5. Technical Requirements**
*   **Architecture:** Layered architecture with a clear separation between the API layer, business logic (leveraging the Opay core), and external integrations.
*   **Technology Stack:** Primarily Go, building upon the existing codebase.
*   **Database:** Secure and scalable database system for storing user data, transaction records, and account balances. Strong emphasis on data integrity and security.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be designed to handle a growing number of users and transactions.
*   **API Design:** Well-documented, RESTful or gRPC APIs for communication with the mobile frontend.

**6. Security Requirements (No Compromise)**
*   **Authentication:**
    *   Strong user authentication mechanism (e.g., password hashing, secure token-based authentication).
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Secure handling of user credentials.
*   **Authorization:** Granular access control based on user roles and permissions.
*   **Data Encryption:**
    *   Encryption of sensitive data at rest (in the database).
    *   Encryption of data in transit (using HTTPS/TLS).
*   **Fraud Detection and Prevention:** Mechanisms to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.
*   **Compliance:** Design the system with a focus on meeting relevant financial regulations and standards (e.g., potential future need for PCI-DSS if card payments are handled directly, adherence to NIBSS requirements like those mentioned for NIP and e-BillsPay).
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Adherence to secure coding principles to prevent common vulnerabilities.
*   **API Security:** Secure API endpoints, input validation, and rate limiting.

**7. Authentication and Account Creation (No Compromise)**
*   **User Registration:** Secure registration process with verification (e.g., email or phone number).
*   **Identity Verification (KYC):** Integration with KYC/AML service providers to verify user identities. This might involve integration with systems like NIBSS's BVN verification.
*   **Password Management:** Secure password policies, storage, and reset mechanisms.
*   **Account Linking:** Securely linking user accounts to external bank accounts or cards, requiring appropriate verification.

**8. Integration Requirements**
*   **Opay Core:** Seamless integration with the existing Opay module for order processing and state management.
*   **NIBSS APIs:**
    *   Integration with NIBSS NIP for instant inter-bank transfers ([https://admin.vazilegal.com/procedure-for-obtaining-the-nibss-api-in-nigeria/](https://admin.vazilegal.com/procedure-for-obtaining-the-nibss-api-in-nigeria/)).
    *   Integration with NIBSS e-BillsPay for bill payments ([https://contactcentre.nibss-plc.com.ng/support/solutions/articles/47001250973-e-billspay-middleware-implementation-api-documentation](https://contactcentre.nibss-plc.com.ng/support/solutions/articles/47001250973-e-billspay-middleware-implementation-api-documentation)).
    *   Potential integration with NIBSS CentralPay for web-based collections ([https://nibss-plc.com.ng/services/central-pay](https://nibss-plc.com.ng/services/central-pay)).
    *   Adherence to NIBSS technical specifications and security requirements for API integration.
*   **Partner Bank Integration:** Design the system to allow for future integration with a capital bank's systems for currency storage and settlement. This might involve specific APIs or protocols provided by the bank.
*   **Other Potential Integrations:** (To be defined later if needed) SMS gateways for notifications, email services, etc.

**9. Error Handling and Monitoring**
*   Comprehensive logging of application and transaction events.
*   Robust error handling and reporting.
*   Monitoring of system performance and availability.
*   Alerting for critical errors or suspicious activities.

**10. Admin Panel (Phase 2)**
*   Web-based interface for administrators to:
    *   View and manage users.
    *   Monitor transactions.
    *   Access reports and analytics.
    *   Configure system settings.

This document provides a high-level overview of the requirements. As we proceed, we may need to refine these and add more detailed specifications.

Please review these requirements. Once you are satisfied, I can start working on implementing the foundational components, beginning with secure user authentication and account creation, and building the API layer on top of the Opay core.
