Okay, I understand. Building a secure and robust backend for a mobile payment application that can eventually partner with a capital bank is a significant undertaking, requiring careful planning and execution without compromising on critical aspects like security and authentication.

Based on your request and the context gathered from the existing Opay codebase, the NIBSS information, and the general guide on building payment apps, I will first outline a requirements document. This will ensure we have a clear scope and understanding of what needs to be built before we start coding.

Here is a draft requirements document for the mobile payment application backend:

**Mobile Payment Application Backend Requirements Document**

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the requirements for the backend system of a mobile payment application. The system will be built upon the existing Opay core codebase and will provide a secure, scalable, and reliable platform for managing user accounts, processing various types of payment transactions, and integrating with external financial services, including NIBSS APIs and future partner bank systems.

This document provides a high-level overview of the requirements. As we proceed, we may need to refine these and add more detailed specifications.

Please review these requirements. Once you are satisfied, I can start working on implementing the foundational components, beginning with secure user authentication and account creation, and building the API layer on top of the Opay core.


backend development phases




Okay, I understand. We will ignore the persistent linter error on line 30 of `internal/database/user_repository.go` for now and move forward with building the rest of the authentication and account creation logic.

Based on our plan, the next step is to complete the `AuthService.Register` method in `internal/auth/auth_service.go`. This involves:
1.  Checking if a user with the given username already exists using `userRepo.FindUserByUsername`.
2.  Hashing the provided password (which we've already added the bcrypt part for).
3.  Creating the new user in the database using `userRepo.CreateUser`.
4.  Creating a default account for the new user using `accountRepo.CreateAccount`.

I will now edit `internal/auth/auth_service.go` to implement these steps in the `Register` method.



Okay, I will proceed with implementing the `AuthService.Login` method and the necessary steps to complete the authentication flow, ignoring the specific linter error we encountered earlier.

The next step is to implement the login logic in `internal/auth/auth_service.go`. This requires generating a secure token upon successful authentication. I will add a JWT library to the project for this purpose.

```bash
go get github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5
```

I have added the JWT library. Now I will implement the `Login` method in `internal/auth/auth_service.go`. This will involve fetching the user, comparing the password hash, and generating a JWT token upon successful authentication. I will also add a field for the JWT secret key to the `AuthServiceImpl`.



Now that the authentication service has the core logic for registration and login, the next crucial step is to implement the database operations for user accounts. This will involve writing the code in `internal/database/account_repository.go` to persist account data.

I will implement the `CreateAccount` method in `internal/database/account_repository.go` to save a new account record to the database.



Okay, acknowledging the instruction to ignore the linter error and move on.

We have implemented the core logic for user registration and login in the `AuthService` and the database persistence for users and accounts in their respective repositories.

The next logical step in building the backend is to create the API layer that the mobile application will interact with. This involves defining the endpoints for user registration and login and implementing the handlers that will process incoming requests and call the `AuthService`.

I will now create the file `api/handler/auth_handler.go` and define the request/response structures and the handler functions for `/register` and `/login`.



Okay, we'll continue building the backend layer. We have defined the API handlers for registration and login. The next logical step is to create the main entry point of the application, set up the server, and wire together the database, repositories, services, and handlers.

I will create a `cmd/api/main.go` file to serve as the application's entry point. This file will handle database connection, dependency injection, and setting up the HTTP server.



Okay, I will address the new linter error by adding the `gorilla/mux` dependency.

```bash
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
```
I have added the `gorilla/mux` dependency and created the `cmd/api/main.go` file, which sets up the basic application structure, including database connection (with placeholders for credentials), repository and service initialization, and HTTP route handling for registration and login using `gorilla/mux`.

We now have the foundational components for secure user authentication and account creation in place:

*   **User and Account Models and Repositories:** Defined how user and account data will be structured and interacted with in the database.
*   **Authentication Service:** Implemented the core logic for user registration (including secure password hashing and default account creation) and login (including password comparison and JWT token generation).
*   **API Handlers:** Created the handlers to receive registration and login requests via HTTP and interact with the authentication service.
*   **Main Application Entry Point:** Set up the application's starting point, wiring together the different components and starting an HTTP server.

Although we encountered and decided to ignore a persistent linter error related to accessing an error variable in the user package from the database package, the core logic for user creation and lookup in the database repository is now in place according to the corrected implementation we discussed.

The next steps in building the complete backend layer would involve:

1.  **Implementing Remaining Account Repository Methods:** Implement the `FindAccountByID`, `FindAccountsByUserID`, and `UpdateAccountBalance` methods in `internal/database/account_repository.go`.
2.  **Implementing Input Validation:** Add proper validation to the API handlers or a dedicated validation layer to ensure incoming request data is valid and secure.
3.  **Adding Middleware:** Implement middleware for logging, authentication (to protect other API endpoints using the generated JWT tokens), and potentially other concerns like rate limiting.
4.  **Integrating the Opay Core:** Start integrating the existing Opay module (`pkg/opay`) into the service layer to handle transaction processing. This would involve creating services that use Opay's `Do` method and implementing the necessary `IOrder` and `Handler` interfaces for specific transaction types.
5.  **Integrating with External APIs (NIBSS):** Implement the `SettleFunc`s and specific handlers that interact with external APIs like NIBSS for actual money movement.
6.  **Adding Configuration Management:** Move hardcoded database URLs, JWT secrets, and other configuration out into a configuration file or environment variables.
7.  **Implementing Error Handling Refinements:** Improve error handling to provide more specific and user-friendly error messages through the API.
8.  **Adding Tests:** Write unit and integration tests for all components.
